## Simple Summary

Outline of requirements and recommendations of the Security Council composition.

## Abstract
To best enable the security council to fulfill its role, the Security Council composition criteria was designed to consider limitations that could jeopardize its operations, such as geographic limitation, technical capacity, limited members of the same organization, role responsibilities, and values alignment. 

## Motivation
First priority is to increase and ensure that the Security Council is always capable of executing its role despite time zones, legal limitations, critical political situation, technical limitations and potential misalignment.

## Specification
### Criteria: Limited geographic regions

	That the 12 members have permanent residency in at least 4 different time zones, with a maximum of 50% of the members residing in the same country.

	This is due to legal limitations, existing or not-yet existing, that could impact a country due to it occurring into open war, crypto adoption barriers, etc. 

Recommendation: In addition, we suggest a time zone difference amongst the members to increase chances that 2/12 members are always at daylight. Since this cannot be ensured due to traveling, it remains a recommendation.

### Criteria: Technical capacity

	That the council members have technical capacity such as detailed understanding of the impact from technical decisions could have, to avoid an operational breakage and/or attacks.

Recommendation: That the candidates should provide enough proofs of due background and experience.

### Criteria: Limited organization members

	That there is a maximum of 2 members per organisation, as to avoid conflict of interest.


### Criteria: Role responsibilities

	That members are aware of and accept the responsibilities within the role, which must be clearly defined prior to election period.

### Criteria: Values alignment

	That members are aligned with the values of Starknet Foundation.

## Implementation

At time of election, candidates must declare:
1. What organizations they are part of;
2. Their awareness and acceptance for the role and its responsibilities, should they be elected;
3. What it means to them to be in alignment with the values of Starknet Foundation.
4. Their technical background and experience, in accordance with the role's requirements;

There should be a KYC verification by the Starknet Foundation at time of election and before onboarding, when they consider that there should be a maximum of 50% of the members with permanent residency in the same country, not to be publicly disclosed.

Finally, the community and the Starknet Foundation should look to apply best of judgment when evaluating the member's applications considering the criteria above.
